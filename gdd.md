# Overview
## Theme

Shipgame is set in 4131 where humanity has moved on from Earth and moved throughout the universe, Shipgame takes place in a randomly generated rural star cluster.

Star clusters consist of 4-6 star systems with random factions (government, rebel, pirates, etc) scattered around them.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics Brief

- Ships
- Planets
- Diplomacy
- Crew

## Targeted platforms
Our targeted platforms will be **Web** and **Desktop**, this is a good platform to target because Web is easily accessible and if our players wish to play offline, they can download a Desktop version.

## Project Scope 
  - Game Time Scale
    - Cost: Free and open source software forever.
    - Time Scale: This game will take VERY long, this includes the main gameplay mechanics and other quirks.

## Influences (Brief)
  - Carmen Miranda's Ghost, Space Heroes & Other Fools, Where No Man 22, Filk in general
    These songs  are major influences on the games due to each song in each album telling a story, and when you listen to the lyrics you truly hear how great each story is.
  - Dungeons & Dragons 
    A specific campaign that Rain made and played out was a major influence on the design of this game, the tense situations fighting against pirates and the calm managing and interactions between the crew.

## The Elevator Pitch

Imagine a game about a ship in space with randomly generated star systems and randomly generated diplomacy. One game you could be a pirate ship fighting against Rebels and another you could be an Empire ship allying with Rebels to fight pirates. Unlimited fun.

## Project Description

Astrionics is a frre and open source web game in the year 4131, where humanity has spread out throughout the universe. The game takes place in a randomly generated star cluster, which is a group of around one or two dozen stars within 8-21 light years away from each other. Astrionics has FTL technology so flying between planets and stars is shorter than 1-3 minutes.

# What sets this project apart?
This game is practically a story generator, and if you record your stories; it could be nice to look back on.

# Story and Gameplay
## Story (Brief)
Year is 4131, humanity spread out throughout the stars. You are in star cluster with diplomacy and history.

## Story (Detailed)

Let's go over some history. Do note that this only includes technological advancement. Politics and Diplomacy isn't detailed here.

In 2028 the first rocket was sent to Mars, but exploded half way throughout it's journey, forever changing the aerospace industry to master on sustainable rockets instead of mastering launchable rockets.

In 2035, the fourth mission to Mars was sent, successfully landing and marking the second exploration of space for the human race.

In 2084, the first rockets to Venus and Jupiter were sent, with them arriving successfully.

In 2189, the milestone of 1 billion colonists on Mars was achieved, the milestone of 1 million colonists on Jupiter and Venus was also achieved.

In 2283, the whole of Sol was officially conquered by the human race, and expansions to the local stars was made.

In 2345, the first prototype of FTL technology was made, allowing for 2x the speed of light, cutting trips from near 6 years to just 6 months.

In 2387, the stable FTL technology was released, allowing for trips between stars within 5-15 minutes instead of 6 months.

In 2475, the local stars were conquered and eventually, the galaxy, the galaxies and the whole universe.

In 2853, the milky way was officially conquered and full of human life everywhere.

In 3021, the first discovery of alien life was found. A tube of bacteria was found on a planet.

In 3026, the first humanoid entities of alien life were found. The mothpeople were humanoid moth-like creatures that were good at mechanical and electrical engineering.

In 3034, more humanoid entities were found. Upon catching one, they were pure stone individuals, nicknamed Stone. These entities were dumb but good at fighting one on one.

In 3928, the universe was finally conquered by a combination of humans, rocks and mothpeople.

There is no central government or central company due to the vast space and how it can take nearly 8 months to travel even the simplest of information from one corner of the universe to the other, and instead each star cluster is like a small country.

Welcome to Astrionics.

## Gameplay

The general gameplay is turn based. You have 25 points to spend on actions, moving is 1 action, repairing is 3, FTL is 5, etc. After the 25 points are spent (or the player skips their turn), the world either regenerates their 25 points or lets the opponent fight depending on whether they are in PvP or not.

### Ships
Humanity is no longer stuck in a finite world, and instead all live in starships ranging from the most basic ship you need to travel to the most luxurious ships.

Each ship is made out of Parts (which you can buy at trading posts) each consisting of total hull health, shields and others.

A ship requires 3 basic Parts. Those being:
- Bridge
- Life Support
- Breakroom
- Engines

You require a Bridge to pilot the thing, afterall, how are you going to fly? You require a Life Support generator in order for the ship to have an atmosphere, you require Engines to warp and fly in general and you need a Breakroom to, well, rest!

### Crew

Ships are made of Crew, you are able to select Crew and make them move to specific rooms in order to operate them.

Crewmembers consist of skill levels, this means your average security officer cannot repair engines, and your average engineer cannot operate weaponry.

A sample of gameplay with Crew would be as such:
- Being attacked by pirates
- Captain is at the bridge, engines are down
- Engineer is relaxing at the breakroom
- Select the engineer
- Move the engineer to engines
- Repair button unlocked in the engines
- Click repair button
- Engines are now repaired


### Diplomacy

Due to humanity no longer being stuck in a finite world (earth), there are randomly generated factions. These factions have 4 types (if you wish to read  more, read the details section), those being:
- Government
- Criminal
- Neutral
- Rebel

Upon clicking Play, the game generates a new star system with diplomacy and history behind it.

### Planets

Planets are the main way of progressing in Astrionics. When docked at planets, you can mine, trade, buy or sell.
Planets interact with diplomacy by having each planet owned by a specific faction.

## Example Gameplay
A sample of gameplay in Astrionics would be:
- Fly through space from independent LK-23 to empire controlled JK-53 after a mining run
- While travelling, get stopped by an empire ship
- The empire ship requests to tax your cargo.
- You can either:
- Attack
- - Win and go to JK-53
- - Lose and potentially be destroyed
- Submit
- - Lose some of your cargo
