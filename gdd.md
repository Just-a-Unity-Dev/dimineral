# Dimineral Design Doc

## Theme

Dimineral is set in 2462 where humanity has spread out across the local galaxy with a technology called Rivers. Rivers allow regular metal scraps to fly across the galaxy at FTL speeds.

You are a mining colony in a randomly generated planet, in which you control 3 miners and begin to mine.

Your system has diplomatic relations that can affect your playthrough.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics Brief

- Mining
- Planets
- Diplomacy
- Crew

## Targeted platforms

Our targeted platforms will be **Web** and **Desktop**, this is a good platform to target because Web is easily accessible and if our players wish to play offline, they can download a Desktop version.

## Project Scope

- Game Time Scale
- Cost: Free and open source software forever.
- Time Scale: This game will take VERY long, this includes the main gameplay mechanics and other quirks.

## Influences (Brief)

- Carmen Miranda's Ghost, Space Heroes & Other Fools, Where No Man 22, Filk in general
    These songs  are major influences on the games due to each song in each album telling a story, and when you listen to the lyrics you truly hear how great each story is.
- Dwarf Fortress, C:DDA, Ascii Sector
    Other major influences for being so darn complex yet still give me joy and fun playing them.

## The Elevator Pitch

Imagine a game about mining in a randomly generated planet and randomly generated diplomacy. One game you could be mining peacefully before pirates raid, or you could get your exports seized by the local dictator.

## Project Description

Dimineral is a free and open source web game in the year 2462, where humanity has spread out throughout the galaxy. The game takes place in a randomly generated star system, moreover a planet.

## What sets this project apart?

This game is practically a story generator, and if you record your stories; it could be nice to look back on.

## Story and Gameplay

## Story (Brief)

Year is 2462, humanity spread out throughout the stars. You are in star cluster with diplomacy and history.

## Gameplay

### Mining

Select a miner, and send them to the mines. After 10 seconds, they may arrive with ores. There should be a random probability to have events occur such as artifacts, and more.

### Crew

Your colony is made of Crew, you are able to select Crew and make them move to specific rooms in order to operate them.

Crewmembers consist of skill levels, this means your average security officer cannot repair engines, and your average engineer cannot operate weaponry.

Players start with 3 crewmembers and have to work their way to multiple crewmembers.

Crew have Health, Hunger, Thirst, Rest and Efficiency. This means that you want enough crew to operate every Part but have enough crew to feed.

**Health**:
While mining, injuries can occur. These range from basic injuries as bruises, broken arms and more which can effect Efficiency.

**Hunger**:
While mining, your miners may get hungry. They require food or may starve to death.

**Thirst**:
While mining, your miners may get thirsty. They require water or may die to dehydration.

**Efficiency**:
Affecting combat and mining, low efficiency means longer mining and less ore mined.

### Diplomacy

Due to humanity no longer being stuck in a finite world (earth), there are randomly generated factions. These factions have 4 types (if you wish to read  more, read the details section), those being:

- Government
  - Dictator
  - Empire
  - Normal
- Traders
  - Weapon Traders
  - Equipment Traders
- Neutral
- Pirate

Upon clicking Play, the game generates a new star system with diplomacy and history behind it.

### Planets

Planets consist of main ore, atmosphere, and more.

## Example Gameplay

A sample of gameplay in dimineral would be:

- Mine
- One of your miners finds an artifact
- Mess with it
  - Potentially get a good artifact which gives more money than exporting it
  - Potentially get an artifact which kills some of your miners
- Leave it alone
  - Throw it into the lava, never to be seen again
- Export it
  - Get money
  - Might trigger and kill miners
